# Welcome to the BeerStatic repository

This repository includes the codes and data for statistical analysis of Brewdog brewery beer recipes.

# The recipe data

The Brewdog recipe data can be retrieved from samjbmason/punkapi GitHub repository, where it lives in JSON format. The recipe data can be thought to consist of 4 elements (methods, malts, hops, info). In the *data/punk_recipes.csv* comma separated data file, these elements are combined into a single tabular data format.

## The combined recipe data

In addition to fetching and processing the raw JSON data, the *data/punk_recipes_create.R* script shows how to combine the 4 parts of the recipe data into a table where each row descripes the features for a recipe of a single Brewdog beer. The data includes the following features:

- Beer name, id, description etc
- End product stats: abv, ibu, target_fg, target_og, ebc, srm, ph, attentuation, volume
- Brewer's tips and food pairings
- 238 columns describing the **hops** in the beer. The Hop columns are named as *"Hop".name.attribute.add*. The *attributes* are one of "bitter", "flavour", "aroma", "twist". *Add* is one of "start", "middle", "end", "dry hop". The value of each column is the amount of the hop used (in the way as described by it's attributes) in the beer. A single hop can be used in multiple ways in one beer. The value of a "Hop.*"" column is zero if the name-attribute combination is not used in the beer.
- 90 columns describing the **malts** in the beer. Each column gives the name of the malt in a format: *"Malt".name*. The value of each column is the amount of malt used in the beer. The value is zero if the malt was not used in the beer.
- 14 columns describing the **methods**: mash temperatures and units and a few columns describing fermentations temperatures. 

# Getting started

The *data/punk_recipes.csv* is a comma separated file where each row describes the recipe for a single Brewdog beer. It can be read into R as follows:

```
beer <- read.table("data/punk_recipes.csv", sep = ",")
dim(beer) # [1] 234 371
```
