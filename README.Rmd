# Welcome to the BeerStatic repository

This repository includes the codes and data for statistical analysis of Brewdog brewery beer recipes.

# The recipe data

The Brewdog recipe data can be retrieved from samjbmason/punkapi GitHub repository, where it lives in JSON format. The recipe data consist of 4 elements, which are combined into a single tabular data format, where each row describes the recipe for a beer.

## The recipe data in 4 parts

The *create_punk_recipes.R* script can be used to accesses the data files in samjbmason/punkapi and processes the JSON recipes into first 4 *R data frames* describing the

- Methods
- Malts
- Hops
- Other information

related to the beers. Those 4 data frames can then also be combined into a single tabular data file. 

## The combined recipe data

The *create_punk_recipes.R* shows how to combine the 4 parts of the recipe data into a single tabular data file. Each row in the data descripes a single beer. The data includes the following features:

- General information about the beer: name, id, description etc
- End product stats: abv, ibu, target_fg, target_og, ebc, srm, ph, attentuation, volume
- Brewer's tips and food pairings
- 238 columns describing the hops in the beers. The Hop columns are named as *Hop.<hop_name>.<hop_attribute>.<hop_addtime>*. The attributes are one of "bitter", "flavour", "aroma", "twist". The addtime is one of "start", "middle", "end", "dry hop". The value of each column is the amount of the hop used in the way described by it's attributes in the beer. The amount is zero for the hop-attribute combinations not used in the beer.
- 90 columns describing the malts in the beer. Each column gives the name of the malt in format *Malt.<malt_name>*. The value of each column is the amount of malt used in the beer. The value is zero if the malt was not used in the beer.
- 14 columns describing the mash temperatures and units and a few columns describing fermentations temperatures. 

# Getting started

The punk_recipes.csv is a comma separated file and it can be read into R as follows:

```
beer <- read.table("punk_recipes.csv", sep = ",")
dim(beer) # [1] 234 371
```
